# Changelog

## Unreleased

### TL;DR
- coord v2: presence can no longer lie. Identities are session UUIDs anchored to the long-lived agent process (a recycled tmux pane never inherits a dead session), peers are liveness-verified (kill -0 + start-time match) into active/idle/dead/stopped/stale with last-seen ages, and territory is data — roles declare exclusive write-domains whose overlaps interrupt both writers. Every v1 CLI form and record keeps working; v1 records upgrade lazily on write.
- Contracts are now load-bearing, not just declared. The registry's promises are enforced four ways: a weekly behavioral audit probes every safe read verb and pings on failures; a drift gate fails the build if the registry promises a command a tool doesn't implement; concurrency is derived from contracts (a `read` tool cannot hold world-write verbs); and natural-language routing asks before executing destructive commands unless `AGENT_DO_AUTO_DESTRUCTIVE=1`.
- Every one of the 23 previously phantom registry commands is now real: built (`manna update/delete`, `slack read`, `discord read`, `clipboard history`, `calendar delete`, `cloud deploy/logs`, `debug backtrace`, `sheets create`, `jupyter kernel`, `dns list`, `logs filter`, `macos tree`, and more), documented where they already worked, or removed with a filed issue where the promise was infeasible (`dns update`, `discord join`).
- New `own_state` contract attribute: tools whose only writes touch their own cache stay parallel-safe instead of being over-serialized.

### Added
- `agent-do kb` — query the Palantir knowledge base over the VID codebase via `POST /kb` (`ask`, `health`, `snapshot` with `--json`; `PALANTIR_KB_TOKEN` via creds, `PALANTIR_URL` optional).
- coord v2 (`tools/agent-coord`) — the state board rebuilt around real incidents from multi-session builds:
  - Liveness-verified presence: records carry pid + process start time; `peers` renders active/idle/**dead**/stopped/stale with last-seen ages, plus `--active-only`/`--writers` filters for hook consumption. Idle retention default dropped 14d → 2d; dead/stopped tombstones age out after 24h and verifiably-gone records sweep on the same TTL.
  - Session-UUID identity anchored to the nearest agent-runtime ancestor (`claude`/`codex`, extensible via `AGENT_DO_COORD_ANCHOR_NAMES`) — per-call harness shells no longer mint an identity per command, and a pane reused by a new process mints a fresh identity while the old record tombstones DEAD. `AGENT_DO_COORD_SESSION` pins identity explicitly; records carry `runtime` and optional `model`.
  - `role set <builder|auditor|researcher|overseer> [--mode] --territory <path>...` — exclusive-writer territories; overlapping writers get a contention interrupt on both sides, auditors on a writer's paths emit a courtesy notice, and `territory show` renders the ownership map with overlap callouts.
  - `guard check [<paths>] [--staged]` / `guard install` — warn-only detection (never blocks) when staged paths intersect a live peer's claim or territory, installable as a pre-commit hook that appends without clobbering existing hooks.
  - Structured focus: goal + phase (building|gating|watching|quiet|blocked|stopped) + note + blocking_on + last_ship; omitted flags preserve, empty string clears; v1 `focus set <goal> --path` unchanged.
  - `drop add <path> --for <agent|role|any> [--key]` / `drops --for-me` — file-pointer handoffs on the board (never content); drops addressed to you or matching a need key raise dependency interrupts. `publish add` gains `--file`.
  - `stop [--note]` / `bye` — clean session retirement (idempotent, Stop-hook safe) instead of writing "stopped" into focus prose; `history [peer] [--limit]` reads the events journal without grepping.
  - `touch` returns `peer_counts` so hooks render live writers first with phase + age, auditors marked read-only, and dead/stale collapsed to a count (session-start + prompt-router updated accordingly).
  - v1 compatibility: every v1 CLI form works, v1 records read as-is and upgrade lazily on write, and `tests/test_coord.py` passes unchanged; new coverage in `tests/test_coord_v2.py` (pane reuse, dead detection via pid/start-time mismatch, both-ways territory contention, migration, anchor walk, tombstone aging).
- SessionEnd hook `hooks/claude/agent-do-coord-stop.sh` retires coord presence at session teardown (only in repos with an existing board); session-start pins `AGENT_DO_COORD_SESSION` from the session_id so retirement hits the identity the session actually used.
- Hook hardening: every `agent-do` spawn inside the Claude hooks now runs under a hard wall-clock bound that SIGKILLs the whole process group on expiry (bash `bounded_run` via perl setpgrp+alarm; python `run_bounded` via `start_new_session` + `killpg`) — a slow or wedged spawn degrades to "no coord context" instead of eating the hook's timeout and discarding its output. Budgets: prompt-router 2s per coord call, session-start 3+3+2+2s under its 10s limit.
- `agent-do harness contracts audit [--include-network] [--out FILE] [--notify]` — bounded behavioral probe of the declared read surface with tri-state grading (ok / clean-skip / fail); `--install-schedule [weekly|daily]` writes a launchd agent that audits automatically and notifies only on failures via `notify emit contracts_audit`. First run found 69 verbs violating their declared shape (mostly snapshot verbs ignoring `--json`) — filed for class-by-class fixes.
- `agent-do harness contracts drift [--tool X]` — diffs registry command promises against each tool's `--help` (zero false positives across all 94 tools); the declared-but-unimplemented channel gates `./test.sh`.
- `agent-do harness contracts surface --json` — machine-readable safety surface for orchestrators: read_only/write/destructive/sensitive/long_running/passthrough/own_state verb lists over the merged registry.
- Routing consumes contracts: the LLM catalog carries per-tool `Safety:` lines; both routers annotate resolved routes with the verb's beats and attributes (after cache writes, so route memory never replays stale safety data); read-leaning intents resolving to write verbs log `route_intent_mismatch` telemetry.
- `AGENT_DO_AUTO_DESTRUCTIVE=1` — natural-language routes to destructive/sensitive verbs ask first (exit 2 clarification) by default; auto mode executes with annotation and telemetry.
- `AGENT_DO_AI_MODEL` now reaches the natural-language router (previously hardcoded).
- Concurrency-from-contracts validator rule: `concurrency: read` with world-write verbs is a gate error; `own_state` writes are exempt.

### Changed
- `dns`, `usb`, `creds`, `clipboard` corrected `read` → `mixed` (their writes hit provider records, the OS mount table, the keychain, the clipboard); `dns` returned to `read` after its phantom `update` verb was removed.
- `figma` emits JSON-safe errors and bounded requests; `sheets` create/write pass user input via argv instead of interpolating into python source (injection fix, plus write's double-nested values bug).

### Fixed — the audit's day-one findings (68 → 0)
- The read surface honors `--json` everywhere: 33 tools gained or repaired JSON output on their snapshot/verify verbs (agent, api, browse api list, ci, clipboard, creds, dpt, eval, gcp, gh doctrine, git log, hardware, homekit, ios, lab, latex, learn, memory, metrics, printer, prompt, repl, serial, ssh, swarm, tail, tui, unbrowse, usb, vm, and more). Plain-text output is unchanged everywhere; `--json` is additive.
- No read verb can hang anymore: `calendar list` (TCC/Automation stalls), `docker ps` (dead daemon socket), `db tables` (no connection), `meetings active/snapshot` (provider probes), and `vision count/faces/ocr/snapshot` (missing source, stalled camera) all gained bounded execution with structured fail-fast errors.
- `manna list --json` and `manna context --json` work (clap previously rejected the flag with empty output); `metrics processes` no longer dies of SIGPIPE (exit 141).
- The weekly scheduled audit now guards all of this: behavioral failures went 68 → 0, with 125 verbs probing clean.
- No network call can hang anymore: every `curl` and `urllib` request across the cloud tools (`clerk`, `cloudflare`, `gcp`, `namecheap`, `okta`, `render`, `resend`, `supabase`, `vercel`) and `discord` now carries `--max-time`/`--connect-timeout` (or `urlopen(timeout=)`), including the requests hidden inside embedded-Python helpers — closing the same hang class that froze CI for 40 minutes, now on a flaky connection instead of a dead daemon.

## v1.3 (2026-06-12)

### TL;DR
- The five-beat mental model (Connect → Snapshot → Interact → Verify → Save) is now machine-readable and enforced. Every one of the 94 tools declares a `contracts:` block in `registry.yaml` mapping each command verb to its beats, with attribute flags for the shapes a single beat cannot express.
- Agents and schedulers can now read per-verb truth from the registry: 890 verbs classified, 469 read-only (safe to parallelize), 51 destructive, 24 secret-emitting, 11 arbitrary-code passthroughs, 26 long-running.
- A gate blocks any new tool from merging without contracts, enforced by `./test.sh` and GitHub Actions CI (the repo's first).

### Added — contracts layer
- `contracts:` blocks on all 94 registry tools (890/890 command verbs classified). Beats stay five; verbs that resist a single beat carry orthogonal attributes instead: `destructive`, `long_running`, `polymorphic`, `composite`, `sensitive`, `passthrough`. Validated against a fixed vocabulary in `lib/registry.py`; a verb declared under multiple beats must explain itself with `polymorphic` or `composite`, and only `passthrough`/`long_running` verbs may stand beat-less.
- `lib/contracts-lexicon.yaml` — the canonical verb→beat/attribute mapping with documented principles (Verify is purposive, not contextual; transforms are interact; destruction is an attribute, not a beat) plus per-tool overrides. `lib/contracts-lexicon-learned.yaml` carries agent-derived classifications with confidence and evidence; the hand lexicon always wins on merge.
- `agent-do harness contracts validate [--strict]` — the gate: registry shape errors plus full-coverage enforcement. `agent-do harness contracts propose [--tool X] [--out FILE]` — regenerates draft declarations and a reviewable inventory whose header aggregates the safety surface (destructive/sensitive/passthrough/long-running verbs across all tools).
- `tests/test_contracts_gate.py` in `./test.sh`: schema validation, attribute vocabulary, full-coverage enforcement, lexicon merge precedence, and a duplicate-YAML-key guard (PyYAML silently keeps the last duplicate mapping key, which can swallow override blocks).
- GitHub Actions CI: `contracts-gate.yml` (registry gate + harness inventory on ubuntu) and `ci.yml` (bash/python syntax sweep on ubuntu; full `./test.sh` on macOS).
- The new-tool rule in `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`: no tool merges without a contracts declaration.

### Changed
- Concurrency classifications corrected where per-verb review exposed lies: `screen` (drives real mouse/keyboard), `resend` (`add`/`verify` are POSTs), and `harness` (`evidence`/`manifest` write files) moved `read` → `mixed`. Distribution is now 57 mixed / 20 read / 17 write.
- The `metrics` registry entry described a fictional tool (`query`/`alert`/`dashboard`); it now declares the real surface (`cpu`/`memory`/`disk`/`network`/`processes`/`load`/`uptime`/`all`). Phantom `slack react` (declared, never implemented) removed.
- Sensitive-blind reads now flagged: `render secret get`, `render kv connect-info`, `render db` (DSN reveal), `browse auth get-creds`, `sms code`/`link` all carry `sensitive`.

### Fixed
- `agent-do --health` could hang forever when the Docker daemon was dead: `bin/health` now bounds external daemon probes (`docker info`, `kubectl cluster-info`) with a 10-second python-backed timeout, since macOS ships no `timeout(1)`. Regression-tested with a shimmed blocking docker (`tests/test_health_probes.py`).

### Added — pre-existing unreleased work
- `agent-do notion` has been rebuilt from a stub into a contract-real Notion team operating layer. It now uses Notion API `2025-09-03`, resolves credentials through `agent-do creds`, supports `doctor`, `snapshot`, workspace/users/search/read/blocks/data-source commands, verified saves for team notes/tasks/decisions/handoffs/comments, local SQLite/FTS cache sync, schema adoption via `bootstrap-team`, webhook ingestion, and optional semantic cache commands.
- The Notion registry entry now documents the required `NOTION_TOKEN`, optional semantic keys, routing keywords, recommended entrypoints, and the team-workspace setup model. `tests/test_notion.py` covers the Notion contract with mocked API responses and is included in `./test.sh`.
- `agent-do obsidian` is now release-ready for local vault usage: `doctor --json` reports local-index mode, note/chunk/embedding counts, feature readiness, and credential readiness without exposing secret values. `agent-do --health obsidian` now treats a readable vault path as ready even when the Obsidian CLI is not installed.
- `agent-do creds required <tool>` now supports feature-level credential presentation from `registry.yaml`, so tools can explain which API keys are required, optional, or only needed for specific capabilities. The Obsidian registry entry now documents no-key vault operations plus `VOYAGE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `COHERE_API_KEY` setup.
- The README now documents Obsidian local-index setup, semantic vault search setup, vault chat setup, and the public credential-discovery contract through `agent-do creds required <tool>`.
- `lib/snapshot.sh` `snapshot_field` now encodes string values via `python3`'s `json` module when available, covering the full RFC 8259 control range (`U+0000`–`U+001F` plus `\\` and `\"`); a manual fallback covering the named C0 controls is used when `python3` is unavailable. `snapshot_error` now routes its message through the same encoder so error JSON is consistent with snapshot JSON.
- `lib/snapshot.sh` `snapshot_end` now bounds invalid-UTF-8 failures to the offending value: each string is tried with strict UTF-8 decode and, on failure, re-decoded with `errors="replace"` so its bad bytes become U+FFFD. Sibling string fields keep full encoder semantics, snapshot output remains valid UTF-8 and valid JSON, and the helper no longer silently downgrades the whole snapshot to manual fallback when one value contains invalid bytes.

## v1.2 (2026-05-14)

### TL;DR
- `agent-do` is now a stronger default agent layer. It helps agents fetch fresh docs, handle auth, work GitHub PRs, coordinate with other agents, and send status updates.
- For current docs, the main command is now `agent-do context retrieve "<question>" --fresh --max-tokens 8000`.
- Local skills now show `local skill - no versioning` instead of looking like broken web docs.
- The public repo is cleaner. Local notes and non-release material belong under `.dev/`.

### Added
- `agent-do psql` for PostgreSQL CLI operations via the native `psql`/`pg_dump`/`pg_restore` binaries. Connection management with macOS Keychain-backed profiles, schema exploration (snapshot, tables, views, describe, schemas, extensions, sizes, relations), data operations (query with auto-LIMIT, sample, count, exec), admin commands (connections, locks, stats, indexes, version), and backup/restore. All output is structured JSON. Complementary to `agent-db` (which uses Python drivers for multi-database support). Table name validation prevents SQL injection in identifier interpolation. Schema-qualified table references (`schema.table`) are parsed correctly across all table commands. Snapshot integration on connect, query, and exec for audit trail.
- Fresh docs support in `agent-do context`, including refresh, stale checks, HTML docs, local docs serving, source version checks, and last-good fallback when the network fails.
- GitHub PR work commands in `agent-do gh`, including inbox, awaiting review, diffs, review threads, checks, audits, replies, approvals, merge work, checkout, ready, and draft.
- Auth flow support in `agent-do auth`, with encrypted auth bundles, browser import, SSO, TOTP, email codes, SMS codes, recovery codes, passkeys, and checkpoint advance.
- Secure credential support in `agent-do creds`, plus registry metadata so tools can say which secrets they need.
- Agent coordination in `agent-do coord`, with focus, claims, needs, published outputs, presence, and interrupt checks.
- Notification support in `agent-do notify`, with SMS, email, Slack, Messenger, local pipes, rules, templates, groups, cooldowns, and delivery history.
- Harness and hook observability in `agent-do harness`, with telemetry, evidence bundles, manifest checks, and nudge outcome tracking.
- New tool families for Resend, hardware, meetings, email, SMS, and repo-local specs.
- `+live(...)` approval support for direct visible-machine actions.

### Changed
- Docs prompts now route agents toward `agent-do context retrieve ... --fresh` instead of weak generic search hints.
- The README is now a front door for agents, with detailed tool workflows moved to docs.
- Browser sessions are isolated per agent by default so parallel agents do not overwrite each other's saved state.
- Browser session import now carries more state, including cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB where possible.
- Auth flows can keep working in a real visible browser when a site blocks headless login.
- Email lookup now uses Apple Mail's local index for faster message and mailbox search.
- Structured dispatch now ignores unregistered `agent-*` binaries on `PATH`.
- `agent-do --health` now reports credential readiness from tool metadata.
- `agent-do macos` and `agent-do screen` now require explicit live approval for direct control actions.
- Public release files were cleaned so generated files, local handoffs, and private working notes stay out of the repo.

### Fixed
- Render service lookup by name works again.
- DPT scoring now checks the right agent-scoped browser socket before scoring.
- GitHub awaiting-review output no longer reports bad `[null]` reviewers.
- Browser `get text|html|value|attr` now sends the right protocol actions.
- Namecheap DNS writes no longer crash after a successful add.

## v1.1 (2026-04-11)

### Added
- `agent-do suggest "<task>"`, `agent-do suggest --project`, and `agent-do find <keyword>` for non-LLM discovery on top of shared registry routing metadata.
- `agent-do nudges stats|recent|clear` for local hook telemetry under `~/.agent-do/telemetry/`.
- Shared `routing` metadata in `registry.yaml` for the first high-value tool set, including discover keywords, raw CLI equivalents, readiness hints, and project signals.

### Changed
- SessionStart hook context is now project-aware and can recommend likely tools for the current repo instead of only a static key-tool list.
- Prompt-submit and PreToolUse hooks now use shared registry routing metadata for more exact hard nudges and concrete replacement commands.
- Offline matching now consumes shared registry routing metadata before falling back to legacy regex patterns.
- Natural-language cache memory is now project-scoped and weighted by route success/failure instead of treating all prior matches equally.

## v1 (2026-04-10)

### Fixed
- Natural-language routing now resolves directory-backed tools correctly instead of trying to execute tool directories directly.
- `agent-do --health` is now a real top-level command rather than an installer-only expectation.
- Offline routing preserves arguments correctly and surfaces clarification questions instead of failing silently.
- Stale `gui` routing no longer leaks into current `macos` flows.
- Missing `PyYAML` on common paths now produces actionable errors instead of Python tracebacks.
- `agent-context` source management now works without `PyYAML`, including the previously failing `sources` fallback path.
- `agent-dpt` is now repo-local instead of depending on an absolute symlink outside the repository.
- `agent-manna` health checks and binary resolution now match the actual `manna-core` build output.

### Added
- `agent-do bootstrap` for idempotent project setup of stateful tools.
- Session-start bootstrap detection that tells Claude to ask once when a project needs `context`, `zpc`, or `manna` initialization.
- Runnable browse tests via `vitest` in `tools/agent-browse`.
- Repo-local DPT source, install script, wrapper binaries, and documentation.

### Changed
- README, integration docs, architecture docs, and project CLAUDE guidance now document `--health`, bootstrap, and current first-run verification.
- Root smoke tests now validate bootstrap behavior in addition to direct, offline, and health-check flows.
- Claude Code hook guidance now reflects the real non-interactive SessionStart model: hooks inject context, Claude asks in conversation.

### Validation
- `./test.sh`
- `bash tools/agent-context/test/integration.sh`
- `cd tools/agent-browse && npm test`
- `bash tools/agent-manna/test/integration.sh`
